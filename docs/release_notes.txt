PEAR_PackageFileManager_Cli Release Notes
=========================================

Notes
 - PHP Compat Info will need to be improved if this is to be included, PFM
   interface will need to be debugged
 - When editing an existing file, the baseinstalldir is guessed by preparsing 
   the package file.

Possible proposal discussion

 - Coding standards for a script
 - UI improvements
 - Clear up release management
 - Clear up baseinstalldir usage
 - Licenses
 - Can PFM import phprelease stuff, like <install> instructions?
 - PEAR_PFM should be able to detect anything executable in the scripts 
   directory and change role to script.  The baseinstall dir should also be set
   to empty as the installer will try to create this directory under bin_dir 
   regardless of the install-as definition. Also for any script, an install-as
   definition should be added.

Roadmap

 - Delete dependencies individually
 - File vs CVS mode
 - Ability to add manage files
 - Validation - batch and per answer
 - Multiline answers (description)
 - Add more options to dependencies (excludes, recommended)
 - Add postinstall task
 - Possibly store user settings, which would be saved in a .pfmrc file.
 - Possibly let user determine release date and time
 - Add options to replace task
