   the package file.

 - Add more options to dependencies (excludes, recommended)
 - Add postinstall task
 - Possibly store user settings, which would be saved in a .pfmrc file.

Possible proposal discussion
----------------------------
 - Coding standards for a script
 - UI improvements
 - Clear up release management
 - Clear up baseinstalldir usage
 - Licenses
 - Can PFM import phprelease stuff, like <install> instructions?
 - PEAR_PFM should be able to detect anything executable in the scripts 
   directory and change role to script.  The baseinstall dir should also be set
   to empty as the installer will try to create this directory under bin_dir 
   regardless of the install-as definition. Also for any script, an install-as
   definition should be added.
